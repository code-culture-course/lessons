# Code Culture Course - Lessons

Welcome to the **lessons** repository for the Code Culture Course! This repository serves as the central learning hub for students and instructors, containing structured lesson modules, code examples, homework assignments, and teaching materials designed to build strong programming fundamentals and software engineering culture.

## About This Repository

This repository is part of the [Code Culture Course](https://github.com/code-culture-course) organization, which focuses on teaching programming fundamentals, clean coding practices, and the cultural aspects of professional software development. Whether you're learning Python basics, exploring object-oriented programming, or mastering Git workflows, you'll find organized, practical materials here to guide your journey.

## Repository Structure

The lessons are organized into topic-based modules, each containing:

- **Lesson materials**: Markdown files with explanations, concepts, and theory
- **Code examples**: Working Python scripts demonstrating key concepts
- **Exercises**: Practice problems to reinforce learning
- **Homework assignments**: Larger projects and assignments for hands-on experience
- **Supporting documents**: Additional resources, references, and guides

Typical module structure:
```
module-name/
├── README.md          # Module overview and objectives
├── lessons/           # Lesson content and explanations
├── examples/          # Code examples and demonstrations
├── exercises/         # Practice problems
└── homework/          # Assignment specifications
```

Topics covered include:
- Python basics and syntax
- Modules and packages
- Testing and test-driven development
- Input/Output: console interaction and file operations
- Data formats (JSON, CSV, YAML)
- Command-line interface (CLI) projects
- Git workflow and version control
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Clean code principles

## Who This Is For

### Students
If you're enrolled in the Code Culture Course, this repository contains all the materials you need to follow along with lessons, complete assignments, and practice coding. Use it as your primary reference for course content.

### Instructors
This repository serves as the shared curriculum for teaching the Code Culture Course. Instructors can maintain, update, and extend lesson materials to keep content current and relevant.

## How to Use This Repository

### Reading Lessons
Browse the repository on GitHub or clone it locally to read lesson materials in your preferred editor or viewer.

### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/code-culture-course/lessons.git
cd lessons
```

### Running Code Examples
1. Navigate to the module you're studying
2. Copy or run example files directly:
```bash
python examples/example_script.py
```
3. Experiment by modifying the code and observing results

### Working on Assignments
1. Read the homework specifications in the relevant module
2. Create your own repository or folder for your solutions
3. Test your code thoroughly before submission
4. Follow any submission guidelines provided by your instructor

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of these materials, you should have:

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
- **Git** for version control
- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or similar)
- Basic command-line familiarity
- Curiosity and willingness to learn!

No prior programming experience is strictly required for introductory modules, but later topics assume you've completed earlier lessons.

## Philosophy: Why Code Culture Matters

Writing code is only part of being a software engineer. The Code Culture Course emphasizes:

- **Readability**: Code is read far more often than it's written
- **Maintainability**: Write code that others (and future you) can understand
- **Collaboration**: Learn practices that make teamwork effective
- **Professionalism**: Develop habits used in real-world software teams
- **Continuous learning**: Stay curious and embrace growth

Good code culture leads to better software, happier teams, and more successful careers.
